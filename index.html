            <p> Hello, my name is Rukayat Yusuf. I am a Sophmore in Hunter collge. I like the Quran.
                One of my favorite part at Hunter college is the MSA where I get to meet all my girlies 
                and learn from each other. One fun fact about me is I speak Yoruba and I'm learning Arabic. 
                I recently visited Nigeria where I had oppurtunity to attend my cousin wedding. I had so much fun! </p>
