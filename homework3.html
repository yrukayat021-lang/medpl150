  <h1>Homework 3: Depth of Field</h1>

  <p>
    For Homework 3, I posted four JPG images on this single page: a shallow depth of field photo,
    a deep depth of field photo, a Photoshop blur version, and the original image for comparison.
    All images are under 2 MB and saved inside the <b>images</b> folder.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Shallow Depth of Field</h2>

  <img src="images/shallow.jpg" alt="Shallow Depth of Field" width="300">
  <p>
    Settings: f/2.8, 1/400s, ISO 100. The subject is sharp while the background is blurred.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Deep Depth of Field</h2>

  <img src="images/deep.jpg" alt="Deep Depth of Field" width="300">
  <p>
    Settings: f/11, 1/125s, ISO 200. Both foreground and background appear sharp.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Photoshop Blur Version</h2>

  <img src="images/photoshopblur.jpg" alt="Photoshop Blur using Field Blur" width="300">
  <p>
    I used Filter → Blur Gallery → Field Blur to blur the background while keeping the subject sharp.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Original Image</h2>

  <img src="images/original.jpg" alt="Original Image Before Blur" width="300">
  <p>
    This is the original image before applying the Photoshop blur effect.
  </p>

  <h2>Reflection</h2>

  <p>
    Write your 250-word reflection here. Explain what you photographed, how aperture (f-stop)
    affected shallow vs. deep depth of field, what you learned about ISO and shutter speed,
    and what adjustments you made in Camera Raw and Photoshop.
