  <h1>Homework 3: Depth of Field</h1>

  <p>
    For Homework 3, I posted four JPG images on this single page: 
    a shallow depth of field photo, a deep depth of field photo, 
    a Photoshop blur version, and the original image used for comparison. 
    All images are under 2 MB and saved inside the <b>images</b> folder.

  <!-- REFLECTION -->

  <h2>Reflection</h2>

  <p>
    I photographed my phone and experimented with both shallow and deep depth of field to understand how aperture affects focus. In the shallow depth of field image, I used a low f-stop to keep the subject sharp while allowing the background to blur naturally. This helped single out the subject and create visual interest because it directs the viewer’s attention exactly where I want. In the deep depth of field image, I used a higher f-stop so that both the foreground and background remained sharp. This made the image feel more detailed and allowed the viewer to see more of the environment. 
    For the Photoshop blur comparison, I used the original image and applied Filter → Blur Gallery → Field Blur. I selected the background and applied blur while keeping the subject sharp. However, I liked how the original image already looked, so I only made a slight adjustment to the blur. Because of that, the difference between the original and the Photoshop blur version may not be very eye catching, you might not even see it. I just really didn’t like how it looked when I blurred it out too much so I kept it as 15px. I learned how aperture (f-stop) controls depth of field and how it changes the mood of an image. I also learned that Photoshop can simulate shallow depth of field, but in-camera settings often produce a more real and better result.
