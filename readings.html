            Susan Sontag’s essay “In Plato’s Cave,” from On Photography offers a perspective that photography structures the way we understand reality. Sontag argues that photography is simply a representation of the one in control not truly reality. She taps into how the one being the camera in a sense is the one being shown. Sontag states “photographers are always imposing standards on their subject”. In other words the photographer has a point of view they wish to show the viewer, how they see the world not necessarily how the world really is. The photographer is the one who decides what looks good, how the individual should appear in the photo, or decides the story behind the photo. All that I’ve mentioned gives a photographer way more power and autonomy than most of us think.
A photo isn’t just a picture, it is a selective interpretation of the world that a photographer specifically frames as such. The author also states “Photographed images do not seem to be statements about the world so much as pieces of it, miniatures of reality that anyone can make or acquire.” In this sentence we see the word “ make”. To make something is to personalize something. Images are just a small glimpse into reality in fact, if you have to “make” reality is it really reality? With the understanding I have off reality, one has to see, feel, and experience for their own selves. They must look with their own eyes. Feel with their own hearts, and think with their own minds, not another.
Photography is an intimate field. The photographer can be seen as the boss while the one being photographed is an employee. The photographer has power while the one being photographed does not. Such a dynamic can have repercussions and both parties should understand that before moving forward. 
Back to the concept of reality. Images or pictures can provide true narratives yet false narratives. The author explains how photographers are most concerned with mirroring reality, but their training or their taste and conscience cannot be detached when trying to mirror reality. I think this is where reality might not make sense for people. Because if everyone is different and has their own understanding doesn’t that equally mean everyone’s reality is different? As a viewer can we truly say an image or a picture is not reality, just because it doesn’t conform to our own understanding of reality? 
Through the understanding of Susan, in today’s world, we can simply represent the world by combining photographs of everyday life with different texts that reveal what is often kept away. Either it is the inequality many people are facing, or digital overload. This mix of image and text can bridge the gap between how the world looks on the surface and the deeper realities shaping people’s experiences as we speak. We as a collective, can choose the frame, the moment, the angle, the lighting, the style, but first and foremost the truth. I read somewhere how a photo is like a window onto the world but through the eyes of the photographer. Everything is truly about one’s perspective.
