  <h1>Homework 2: Reflection on Photography and Photoshop</h1>

  <p>
    I chose these two pictures because it was difficult for me to focus. I was confused, frustrated, upset, rigid, all of the above, which all can be seen through these two photos. Darkness, blurriness are depicted extraordinarily well in the photos I picked. These two photos illustrate my visible or current feelings at the time I was taking them. The photo of “EXIT” was a very captivating scene because I felt like exiting. The ideas that were foremost in my mind while taking these two photos was the centered composition. I aimed to position the object in the center to attain the viewers attention by having them focus on one thing. I also used cropping to make my photos less distracting, very straight to the point. Next time I aim to enter with focus so my pictures will be more focused. I also tried to incorporate depth by including the background and foreground. I’m not sure how well I did in accomplishing that but to be honest I really tried. To expand on the “EXIT” photo, it was very surprising to me how clear that photo is. Out of all the photos I took, the EXIT was the clearest of them all.
